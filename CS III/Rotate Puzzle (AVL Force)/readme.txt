I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 with Microsoft C++ Compiler (MSVC)

This program requires inputs to function properly.
(1): The first input asks for (b/a) (or (bruteForce/A*). Input 'a' to use the aStarSearch
	way and 'b' (or anything else as it's an if()/else()) to run the bruteForceSearch.
(2): The second input asks (if you've already selected 'a') for (y/n) for whether or not you want to 
	print all the boards leading up to the solve or not.
