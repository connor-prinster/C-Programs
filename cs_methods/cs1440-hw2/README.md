## Overview
In this assignment, you will create a program to analyze weather data, namely precipitation data from the National Centers for Environmental Information. Since the purpose of this assignment is to become familiar with Cloud9 and to start thinking about code organization, you won't actually need to write any new code yourself. Instead, you will reorganize a single .cpp file into separate .cpp and .h files.
